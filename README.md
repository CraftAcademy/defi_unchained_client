## DeFi Unchained Client
DeFi Unchained will become the new go-to hub for people interested in crypto. There’s a page dedicated to displaying various info about the different coins. Then there’s a news section for all logged in users, and finally, we have built a powerful algorithm that is able to determine which coins you should buy. This is of course only for paying subscribers.
